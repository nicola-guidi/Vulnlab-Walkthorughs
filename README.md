# Vulnhub Walkthroughs

This repository contains my personal collection of walkthroughs for machines from **Vulnhub** (and similar platforms).  
Each write-up demonstrates the full exploitation path of a vulnerable machine, from initial reconnaissance to privilege escalation and final root/system access.  

The goal of this repository is to provide:  
- A structured approach to penetration testing in Capture the Flag (CTF)-style environments.  
- Insights into common misconfigurations and real-world inspired vulnerabilities.  
- Step-by-step documentation that can help learners, students, and security enthusiasts sharpen their skills.  

## Walkthroughs

New walkthroughs will be added over time. Each machine has its own dedicated folder with the corresponding write-up and, when relevant, additional resources or exploit scripts.  

Current and upcoming topics include:  
- Linux and Windows privilege escalation  
- Web application exploitation  
- Active Directory attacks  
- Common network service misconfigurations  

## Disclaimer

These walkthroughs are created **for educational purposes only**.  
Do not attempt to reproduce any of the techniques on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
